          means "beloved", and that's basically what this is: a running list
          of the cute, comfy, worth-the-commute spots around Manila that we
          actually go to with each other.

        <p>
          We kept losing track of good places in group chats and screenshots,
          so this exists to fix that, one map, organized by city, category,
          and vibe, with everything you need to actually get there: a Maps
          link, how to commute, and the menu.
